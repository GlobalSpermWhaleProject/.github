## Research Objectives
The Male Sperm Whale Global Perspective Project seeks to address key knowledge gaps about broad patterns of male sperm whale movement and behaviour that are beyond the scope of any one localized team, through invaluable partnerships with those local groups. Specifically, this project seeks to better characterize (1) vocal learning and culture, (2) factors influencing reproductive success, and (3) long distance movements (including how they are influenced by body size and condition).

## Research Plan
This work is being led by Christine Clarke, PhD candidate, supervised by Dr. Hal Whitehead at Dalhousie University. We will bring together geographically diverse datasets and leverage several types of data, including acoustic recordings, genetic sequences, photo identification records, behavioural observations, and drone imagery. 

## Time Frame
Work on this project began in January 2025. Collation and auditing of datasets and development of analysis workflows are underway. We aim to have the final data for Objective 1, 2 and 3 contributed by September 2026, May 2027, and December 2027, respectively.

## Impact
The global distribution and far-ranging movements of sperm whales, especially males, make tackling big picture questions challenging, resulting in substantial knowledge gaps. This project will provide new insight on important conservation-relevant aspects of the ecology of male sperm whales, including cultural variation and population connectivity. Beyond the specific research objectives addressed, the project will compile accessible documentation of existing datasets that will be a valuable resource for future collaborative work.
